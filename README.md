# Decision_tree_iris
I used a default dataset in R to script the decision tree model. The accuracy is 97%. The iris data is already cleaned and a standard dataset to practice these ML models.
To further practicing the decision tree model, I need to access a RWD of patients to further practice evaluating a model.
